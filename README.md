This is an interpreter in Java for a made-up programming language. It handles the execution stack, the address table, the heap, output and multi-threading. 
It includes a visual representation of the data structures used in its implementation.
However, it can only load code written as CompoundStatements and they must be written and added manually to a list before running the program.
